                <p>
                    Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for
                    lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible. Some
                    sections still have room for improvement - we plan to tackle these over time.

                    We love WebhookLogs and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a small team and
                    value our work/life balance. This means that although we’ll try our best, we do not provide 24/7
                    support.

                    In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent
                    unreliability of the Internet. We do not offer contracted SLA for availability of the Service and

                    We monitor the Service closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email, push
                    notifications and phone calls) when the Webhooklogs.com is under stress, so that we can deal with
                    the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

                    Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how
                    long an implied warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you. To the extent
                    permissible, any implied warranties are limited to ninety days.

                    Subject to your acceptance of, and compliance with, this Agreement and any payment requirements for
                    the Service (if applicable), Specian Ltd hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
                    non-transferable, revocable, non-sublicensable licence, in and under our intellectual property
                    rights, to access and use the Services, solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
                    Agreement. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features provided by us that augment or
                    enhance the current Service shall also constitute &quot;Service&quot; and shall be subject to these
                    terms and conditions. All rights not expressly granted under this Agreement are retained by Specian.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other Specian
                    services, third party content or third party software. If for any reason a court of competent
                    jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that
                    provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the
                    parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full
                    force and effect. Any failure by Specian to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or
                    related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in
                    the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
